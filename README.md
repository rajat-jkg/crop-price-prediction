## Introduction

This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting crop prices, focusing on maize and wheat. Accurate predictions of crop prices can help farmers, suppliers, and various stakeholders in the agricultural industry make informed decisions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains historical prices, weather information, yield, and other significant factors that influence the price of crops. A part of data is taken from data.gov.in

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The initial phase of the project focused on understanding the data's structure, identifying potential patterns, and noting any anomalies.

Visualizations and detailed EDA reports can be found in the [EDA notebook](./DataSets/EDA.ipynb).

## Models

The next phase involves selecting and training appropriate machine learning models. This section will be updated as the project progresses.
